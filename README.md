# The Composable Architecture Tutorial(Chapter 2)

Explored the basics of creating a new feature in the **Composable Architecture**. Learned how to do domain modeling to **navigate** from parent function to child function, and how to do it concisely using options, enumerations, and collections

### Second look

I've heard more than once about the TCA architecture. I decided to take a course on **[The Composable Architecture Tutorials](https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/tutorials/meetcomposablearchitecture/)** site.

The architecture seems **“clean”** to me, well **testable**. In order to study TCA more deeply, I plan to make a simple application close to real cases (authorization/registration/profile/list) and then understand whether it is worth implementing this architecture in projects.

After taking the second lesson, I am more likely to use standard architectural solutions (MVP, MVVM, VIPER, etc), maybe after working with TCA more closely, I will change my opinion.

At the moment I see **more cons** of using TCA in a real project than **pros**.
